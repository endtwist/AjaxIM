# Ajax IM

## What is Ajax IM?

Ajax IM ("Ajax Instant Messenger") is an instant messenger for the web. It is
intended to be integrated with existing websites to provide a more interactive
community experience.

## Features

* Instant communication between connected users
* Robust backend server built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* Can be integrated with virtually any existing website
* Seamless authentication
* Works across an entire website, unobtrusively
* Automatic state management between page reloads
* User state and statuses
* and _much_ more!

## Installation

Install `Node.js`:

    wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.9/node-v0.8.9-linux-x86.tar.gz
    tar xzf node-v0.8.9-linux-x86.tar.gz
    cd node-v0.8.9
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Install Node Package Manager (`npm`):

    See instructions at http://github.com/isaacs/npm.

Install `Express.js`, `Connect` and `Cookie`:

    npm install express
    npm install connect
    npm install cookie

Compile the daemon add-on if you plan on letting the server daemonize itself:

    cd server/libs/daemon
    node-waf configure build
    cp build/default/daemon.node .
    rm -rf build

## Installation for Development

If you want to test Ajax IM as a standalone app for development, you will need
to install [`Jade`](http://github.com/visionmedia/jade) as well.

To install `Jade`:

    npm install jade

## Starting up the server

Starting the server in _development_ mode is as simple as:

    node server/app.js

To start the server in _production_ mode:

    EXPRESS_ENV=production node server/app.js

To start the server as a _daemon_ in _production_ mode:

    node server/app.js start production

## Testing it out

Once the server is up and running in _development_ mode, you can test it out
through the included development testing app. The below instructions are
assuming that you have left all default configuration options. If not, please
replace the host/port values with the correct ones.

To get started, first initialize a session cookie by going to:

    http://localhost:8000/dev/cookie

Then head over to the development page that will initialize the client:

    http://localhost:8000/dev/

That's it!

### Style Guide

If you intend on contributing, please follow this style guide when submitting
patches or commits. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines will not
be accepted.

* Use 4 space indents (not tabs!)
* No trailing whitespace
* Blank line at the end of files
* Semi-colons at the ends of lines, where appropriate
* Keep lines to 80 characters or less
* Never bump the version

No whitespace between keys and values:

    {foo: 'bar'}
    // good
    
    {foo : 'bar'}
    // bad

Hash formatting:

    {foo: 'bar', baz: 'taz'}
    // good
    
    {
        foo: 'bar',
        baz: 'taz',
        moo: 'cow'
    }
    // good
    
    { foo: 'bar', baz: 'taz' }
    // bad
    
    {foo: 'bar',
     baz: 'taz',
     moo: 'cow'}
    // bad

Chained methods:

    str
        .strip
        .replace(...)
        .replace(...)
    // good
    
    str
    .strip
    .replace(...)
    .replace(...)
    // bad
    
    str.
        strip.
        replace(...).
        replace(...)
    // bad

Single quotes over double quotes, unless double quotes make sense:

    'hello'
    // good
    
    "what's up?"
    // good
    
    "hello"
    // bad

Ternary expressions are fine, but cannot be nested and must be formatted as:

    foo = (a ? b : c);
    // good
    
    foo = (something.hasAPropertyLikeThis == 'some other value'
               ? 'result one'
               : 'result two'
          );
    // good
    
    foo = something.hasAPropertyLikeThis === 'some other value' ?
              'result one' :
              'result two'
    // bad

Use braces for conditionals, unless conditionals are single statements:

    if(foo) {
        bar();
        baz();
    }
    // good
    
    if(foo) bar();
    else baz();
    // good
    
    if(foo)
        bar(),
        baz()
    // bad

Closures:

    function() {
    }
    // good
    
    function () {
    }
    // bad
    
    function()
    {
    }
    // bad

Methods:

    foo.bar = function() {
    }
    // good
    
    foo.bar = function (){
    }
    // bad
    
    foo.bar = function()
    {
    }
    // bad
